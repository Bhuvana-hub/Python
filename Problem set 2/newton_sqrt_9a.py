"""
One way of computing square roots is Newtonâ€™s method. 
Suppose that you want to know the square root of a.
 If you start with almost any estimate, x, 
 you can compute a better estimate with the following formula: y = (x + a/x)/2 
 For example, if a is 4 and x is 3:

import math
def Newtonsqrt(num1,num2):
    y=(num2+num1/num2)/2
    return y
        
def main():
    num1=float(input("Enter the number for which square root has to be find  "))
    num2=float(input("Enter the number which could be assume as square root of num1 "))
    square_root_value=Newtonsqrt(num1,num2)
    print("the square roots value is " ,square_root_value)
